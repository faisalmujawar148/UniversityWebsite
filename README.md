# **Coursework**  

This is the super amazing coursework assignment that demanded more blood, sweat, and tears than I care to admit! It showcases:  
- Proper implementation of the UML diagram.  
- Adherence to Google Java best practices.  
- Uncle Bob's Clean Code principles.  
- Insights from Prof. Donggyun's invaluable lectures.  

Every ounce of effort went into making this project possible.

## **End Notes**  
I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to:  
- My professors (who taught me everything I know).  
- Uncle Bob (for clean code tips).  
- The Gang of Four (Design Patterns).  
- My parents, and God.  

With a heavy yet light heart, I'm proud to submit this roller-coaster of a coursework.

## **How to Run the Project**  
1. Clone this repository and the front-end repo (I won't tell you where to find it! haha!).  
2. Have Node.js, Maven, SDKMan, Java(> ver.17) and npm installed.
3. Navigate to the project directory.  
4. Go to either CW1/CW2
5. Run: `mvn clean install; mvn compile checkstyle:check spotbugs:check verify site;`
6. If in CW2, `mvn spring-boot:run;`
7. Now that the backend is running, head to the front-end directory.
8. Run: `npm install` (if you haven't already)
9. Run: `npm run dev`
10. Head to the site (it should be the link generated by Vite) and viola!
